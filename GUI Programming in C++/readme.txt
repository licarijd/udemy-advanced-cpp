C++ is used to create desktop programs as well, eg. Microsoft Word.

There are some APIs that help in developing desktop applications.

Usually it's helpful to use the native API for the given platform.

For example, Windows has an API.

The problem with platform APIs is that they can be finnicky or difficult to work with.


The best thing to do is to use a cross platform API.

Popular Example:

1) wxWidgets - cross platform GUI API, which gives a native look and feel.

2) GTK+ (formerly The GIMP toolkit) - originally used to create the image editor GIMP, it's a multi-platform
toolkit for creating GUIs.

3) Qt Studio - Cross platform framework and tools for developing UIs and applications. Very popular for 
mobile and embedded platforms (like Kobos). It also provides it's own IDE.


It's common to use C++ on the backend, and then wire it to a front end written in another language.
