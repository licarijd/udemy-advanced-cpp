// A dequeue is a doubly-ended queue.
// It's very similar to a vector, but you can add elements to the beginning or the end.
// So, it's not as efficient as a vector, but you get more flexibility.
// So, rather than just a push_back, there's also a push_front, as well as a
// pop_back and pop_front.
